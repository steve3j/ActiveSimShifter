Probably not a new idea, but can't stop thinking about it.

Idea is to have an active sim shifter. It would operate similar to the simucube or diy active pedal except it would have two motors, one for x, one for y axis.

This would allow giving engine rpm and wheel slip based feedback through the stick, 
be difficult to shift out of a gear under load, 
able to shift into gear with no clutch while revs are matched,
not be able to shift into gear while clutch is not pressed, 
gear grinding could pop out of gear while also giving feedback effect, 
could dynamically adjust number of gears depending on the car you are driving, 
could center the stick while in neutral and not shifting to a gear, could simulate old/new cars with adding in slop/tightness to the shifter and light/heavy shifting feel, 
damaged vehicle transmission could pop out of gear or give difficulties with shifting into gear.

Would allow the shifter to operate as a handbrake, sequential shifter, airplane throttle, helicopter cyclic, airplane control stick, construction equipment control stick, etc...

Simple brainstorming:
There's probably a way to make this more compact with both motors parallel to each other, but a simple x/y arrangement could be prototyped. 
Would need a simple shifter bar mounted on a dual axis rotating ball extending down a few inches, 
the bottom of the bar attaches to x and y motors via load cells, 
the end of the attachment bar would attach to a servo motor screw shaft, 
the x/y servo motors would provide the effects.

Need to iron out;
Anyone able to calculate kinematics on this idea? 
Any ideas on how to have the two motors parallel to take less space footprint?
How long of screw shafts are needed?
What pitch of screw shafts are needed? I'd think less than the FFB pedal as arms are weaker than legs.
Could we use smaller motors than the pedals to save cost?
Software? Simhub? (I haven't built an active pedal yet so not sure how all the simhub stuff integrates)
