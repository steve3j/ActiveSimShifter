# ActiveSimShifter
Idea is to have an active sim shifter.
It would operate similar to the simucube or diy active pedal except it would have two motors, one for x, one for y axis.

This would allow giving engine rpm based feedback through the stick, 
  be difficult to shift out of a gear under load, 
  not be able to shift into gear while clutch is not pressed, 
  gear grinding could pop out of gear while also giving feedback effect, 
  could dynamically adjust number of gears depending on the car you are driving, 
  could center the stick while in neutral and not shifting to a gear, 
  could simulate old/new cars with adding in slop/tightness to the shifter and/or light/heavy shifting feel,
  damaged vehicle transmission could pop out of gear or give difficulties with shifting into gear,
  would allow the shifter to operate as a handbrake or sequential shifter.

There's a way to make this more compact with both motors parallel to each other, but a simple x/y arrangement could be prototyped.
Would need a simple shifter bar mounted on a dual axis rotating ball extending down a few inches, 
  the bottom of the bar attaches to x and y motors via load cells,
  the end of the attachment bar would attach to a servo motor screw shaft,
  the x/y servo motors would provide the effects.
